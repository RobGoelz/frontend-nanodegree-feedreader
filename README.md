### Running

Due to the feed reader not working using the usual HTML preview link, please git clone or download the project [from here](https://github.com/RobGoelz/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader). Once you have downloaded the file, open index.html in Chrome or Firefox!

## Contributing

This repository is a fork of the the starter code for _all_ Udacity students, but the JS code in feedreader.js has been modified by me.

I welcome constructive criticism or help to make this program better!
